		<h1>Welcome To Harrys's</h1>
		<h2><a href="#">Our History</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harry's, began as a small company, operating from our garage. 
			When we started our company, we were looking for top of the line hair dryers, 
			unfortunately we could not find a distributor or manufacturer that met our needâ€™s. 
			They all had the corporate mentality of a big company, and we felt that we were getting 
			lost in the shuffle. So we started looking into what it would take to start our owen business 
			and how we could do what we felt was missing from the big box companys. It took us a long time
			to start shiping and moving invotory. It was thanks to out backers on Patron and Kick-Starter
			that allowed us to work full time of this idea of ours.<br><br></p>

		<h2><a href="#">Our Goal</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Since the beginning, Harry's has always kept the customers goals in mind.
			Our goal is getting the customer what they want when they want. We are not happy until we make sure 
			that the product is right for you. </p>
		</div>
		
		<h2><a href="#">Our Suppiers</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p> We get most of our hairdryers from the manufacturer. Since we can buy so many at once we can get them
			cheaper than if you were to buy them from a box store or even from the manufacturer website. We can than pass
			this svaings on to you. Saveing you money and time. We are the one stop shop for all of your hairdryer needs. </p>
