			<p>Our story starts with the company's CEO, Mike Tyler and his wife Jenny. Mike and Jenny started the company from their garage. When they started there was only Mike, Jenny and her brother, Phillip. With that they grew the company until they had three stores and 90 employees. Together, they have been able to help many people find the hair dryer that they need. They have worked with many local hair dressers, barbers, and other customers to help them with the purchase of hair dryer's that they need, at a reasonable price. They have worked extremely hard over the last 5 years to grow their business into a success. The decision was made last year to go online. It has been a learning curve, mixed with many hurdles to over come. The three of them are anticipating through the launch of their website, that they will be able to reach a larger customer base. <br></p>
