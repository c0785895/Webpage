			<p>Our story starts with the company's CEO, Mike Tyler and his wife Jenny. Mike and Jenny started the company from 
			their garage. When they started there was only Mike, Jenny and her brother, Phillip. With that they grew the company
			until they had three stores and 90 employees. Together, they have been able to help many people find the hair dryer 
			that they need. They have worked with many local hair dressers, barbers, and other customers to help them with the purchase
			of hair dryer's that they need, at a reasonable price. They have worked extremely hard over the last 5 years to grow their
			business into a success. The decision was made last year to go online. It has been a learning curve, mixed with many hurdles
			to over come. The three of them are anticipating through the launch of their website, that they will be able to reach a larger
			customer base. <br></p>

			<p><br>Meet our Sales Manager, Joe, and his assistant Claire, who joined our team a year ago. They are responsible for
			tracking and increasing sales growth. <br><br> We are pleased to announce that the weekly campaign, that was created as
			a promotion for the website, will remain. This sale will only be available through the website and will be delivered to 
			you directly.  We will not be running these sales in-store, as they will have their own sales. We have made this decision 
			to help grow our website and due to COVID-19, and to encourage social distancing. and to help grow the website and to
